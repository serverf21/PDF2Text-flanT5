## Personalized ChatGPT for documents

Utilizing OpenAI's API for building large-scale personalized models can be expensive. Theorfore, I have developed a demo ChatGPT for your personal files where you can upload your file and then put questions in form of query to the model.

The model will therefore, generate the answers on the basis of the documents it was trained upon.
